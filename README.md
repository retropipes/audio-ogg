# OGG Audio Library

Java class library providing OGG format audio playback.

Requires Java SE 10 or later (subject to change as newer Java major versions are released).

This was made with Eclipse, and is thus structured as an Eclipse project. All source files are in one package, so migrating it to another IDE is simple.
